1.Inference :
Inference is noting but you don't need to specify type every where as type
as ts is advanced then you.The main place specifying type is in functions
or else it will take any tpe as parameter which is colpletely againist our
type script.
Example ::
let userID = 20 ;(This is best practice ts already knows it's a number type.
So no need to do this let userId : number = 20) ;

2.About Any :
Any is not type it just tells ts not to do any type check.If just declare a variable without
initializing then it will be type any :
Example :
let name ;
name = 123 ;
name= "Teja";
name = true ;

3.Why we use type aliases :
Just and example :
function createUser({name:string,email:string}) : void{
//Body part
} ;

createUser({name:"Teja",email:"teja.ulisetti@gmail.com",isPaid:true});(fails as
extra boolean is missing)
but see this case :
let user = {name:"Teja",email:"teja.ulisetti@gmail.com",isPaid:true};
createUSer(user) ;(It will get success that's the reason typa aliases came
into picture) ;

type User = {
name : String,
email:String,
ispaid: boolean
}(fails)

4.Tuple is used in scenarios to fix the order of array data
Example :
let data : [string | number | boolean] = ["teja",1234,false](correct);
let data1 : [string | number | boolean] = [1234,false,"teja"](fails);
